# Hello-world
My interests are photosynthesis first and foremost because it is the most important thing on earth, geology, chemistry, precious elements and all the others, history more so earlier civilisations, mathematics, english, exotic matter, decentralization, anti matter, the solar system and beyond and many other things. i am a qualified electrician with a distinction in basic electronics, i have experience  in construction an engineering, and have studied geology and i have some ideas just havnt discovered how to put them into practice yet but this seems a very good place to start, thanks 4 reading.
